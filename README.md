# Development-of-Face-Recognation-Algorithms-for-Low-Resolution-Images
In this project, It was carried out using a deep learning-based super resolution model in order to increase the success of low-resolution face recognition systems.

This study aims to contribute to increasing the recognition rate of low-resolution images.

This thesis study, which aims to bring low-resolution face images to super resolution using the Python programming language and the VQFR (Vector Quantization Frequency Refinement) model and 
to design a user-friendly interface with the PyQt5 interface, focuses on increasing the success of face recognition by achieving high resolution.

The VQFR model was effective in restoring high frequency details in low resolution images using the vector quantization frequency refinement technique. 

The results obtained with face recognition algorithms show that the face recognition performance of images super-resolved with the VQFR model increases significantly. 

The PyQt5 interface provides a user-friendly interface so that users can easily select images and control the application of face recognition algorithms with super resolution processing. 

This study makes a valuable contribution to the field of bringing low-resolution face images to super resolution and increasing face recognition success.

Second Step.jpg : Start the VQFR method.
Third Step.jpg : we can see the low resolution (left) image and high resolution (right) image.
Last Step.jpg : face recognition of both the low-resolution photo and the super-resolution photo, and the recognition rates are calculated.
